.Versioning
--
NOTE: The versioning pattern for this project follows this pattern:
  `{core-version}+s34k-{api-version}`. +
  For example, the initial release of this library was `0.1.0+s34k-0.1.0`. +
  As patches or updates happen to this library, the library version number will
  differ from the API version, so for clarity, the API version will be included.
